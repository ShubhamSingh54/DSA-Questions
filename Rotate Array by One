Given an array arr, rotate the array by one position in clock-wise direction.

Examples:

Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]
Explanation: If we rotate arr by one position in clockwise 5 come to the front and remaining those are shifted to the end.
Input: arr = [9, 8, 7, 6, 4, 2, 1, 3]
Output: [3, 9, 8, 7, 6, 4, 2, 1]
Explanation: After rotating clock-wise 3 comes in first position.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

solution --->
key point--> here we iterate the array from end not from starting ;
code--->
void rotate(vector<int> &arr) {
        int a=arr[arr.size()-1];
        
        for(int i=arr.size()-2;i>=0;i--)
        
        { 
         
           arr[i+1]=arr[i]; 
          
        
        }
        arr[0]=a;
        // code here
    }
